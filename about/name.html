      <h1>The Story Behind the Name</h1>

      <p>Basically, everyone I knew from security had a super cool handle that they used outside of their original names. Traditionally, I always went with my last name.</p>
      <p>For a while, this worked. But as I made more friends in the security industry, I noticed that everyone had a super cool handle, and I didn't want to feel left out.
         I don't think that a handle at all conceals your identity, and I don't share the same concerns for anonymity that the rest of the internet does. I'm a firm believer
         in personal security, and hold the belief that if anyone wants to find me, they probably can. However, by taking preventative steps to secure your personal security,
         you can deter those that may want to find you for the wrong reasons.</p>
      <p>So why get a handle at all? I just thought it would be cool.</p>
      <p>I got the name from a random name generator, because I'm not the most creative person in the world. I thought that I would just let it spit out names until one stood out
         that I thought would work as an appropriately cool handle for my interwebz work. So I went to a random name generator site, and on the first roll, it spit out qesix.</p>
      <p>I immediately read this as keh-six and I thought that it was pretty cool at the time, so I went with it. It has since been mispronounced, butchered, and all manner of
         things in between.</p>
